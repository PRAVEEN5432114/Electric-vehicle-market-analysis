# Electric Vehicle Market Analysis Dashboard

This repository contains the **Electric Vehicle Market Analysis** project, which uses **Microsoft Power BI** to analyze trends, adoption rates, and policy impacts on **Electric Vehicles (EVs)** across the United States. The dashboard tracks key metrics such as **Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs)** and **Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs)**, regional adoption, and the effect of **CAFV eligibility**.

## Project Overview

The Power BI dashboard provides insights into:
- EV adoption rates across various U.S. states
- The impact of government policies, such as **CAFV eligibility**
- Market share of **BEVs** vs. **PHEVs**
- **Geographical analysis** of EV growth
- **Key KPIs** like total vehicles, average range, and percentage of BEVs/PHEVs in the market

The project is designed for stakeholders including **policy makers**, **automotive manufacturers**, and **transportation authorities**.

## Tools Used
- **Power BI**: For creating the interactive dashboard and visualizations
- **Microsoft Excel**: For storing the raw dataset (no cleaning was performed in Excel)
- **DAX**: For creating custom measures and KPIs
